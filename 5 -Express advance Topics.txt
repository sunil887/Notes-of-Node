chapter -1 : we will learn middleware 
				configuration
				debugging
				Templtating Engines
chapter - 2 middleware funtion

		these are the function that takes in request object and either 
		return response  to the client or passes control to the another middleware function

		every route handler is middleware function
		
		express.json return middleware that parse body of request if body contains json object and set req.body property.

		request processing pipeline
		pipleline contains one or more middleware function
		
		request							reposnse
		---------->express.json()------------>route handler--------------> terminating  request-response cycle

		express appllication is bunch of middleware function
   

chapter - 3   always make sure to end req-res cycle
		
		each custom middleware function must be keep in separate module/file.

chapter - 4 	there are some middleware available which you can use

chapter - 5    use third party middleware in order like helmet etc from https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware.html

chapter - 6 	we have to know that which enviroment working developng environment or producuction environment
		use $env:NODE_ENV="production" in windows powershell to enable environment variable
		
		Environment 
				production
				staging
				development
chapter - 7 configuration needed  to be done based on various environment present

chapter - 8  console.log can be used to debug application but not a goodway of doing it;
	
		use debug package module 
		const debug  = require('debug')('app:startup'); 
		
		"app:startup" is a userdefined debugging namespace which will be used to set 
		debug environment variable. use powershell to set debug variable using $env:DEBUG:"namespace_name"
		
		setting multiple debug mode DEBUG:"namespace_name1","namespace_name2" 

		example 
			const debug1  = require('debug')('app:startup');
			if(app.get('env') === 'development'){
		        	app.use(morgan('tiny'));
 		 	  	debug1('morgan enabled..');
			}
			debug2('debug2 is here');
		
			RESULT
		 		app:startup morgan enabled.. +0ms
  				app:debug debug2 is here +0ms

		set DEBUG:* to set denug to all namespace available

			

chapter -22  Templating Engine : Sometimes we need to sent HTML markup to the client from api for that we 
		can use "view Engine" like pug ,moustache etc.
